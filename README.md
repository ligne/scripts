# Scripts

Various scripts I've written.
Who knows, someone else might even find them useful?

Most of these will require [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) on your `PATH` to run.

## `ffx-tabs`

Show the tabs in a Firefox session.

## `diffwatch`

Like `watch -d` but with diff-like output.
